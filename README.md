# DacaOne
Case processing time parser in javascript.

DacaOne pulls and parses posts from Reddit(specifically /r/DACA), regarding renewals for form I-821D and I-765, processing posts that provide information regarding renewal timelines and length. No more having to manually search each post in hopes of gauging the current renewal times from USCIS.

Please keep in mind that the data parsed here is all crowdsourced from user posts. Therefore, it should be used in **conjunction** with the official [USCIS case processing times](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) to better determine when to submit your own renewal.

Due to limitations regarding Reddit's API, only posts from 7 months and earlier are obtained and parsed.
